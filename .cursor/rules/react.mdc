## TypeScript

- Do not use explicit return types unless absolutely necessary to resolve typing issues.
- Use type, not interface
- No JSDocs comments that are covered by TS
- Add comments only when they add context to the function or variable

## CSS / Tailwind CSS

- Always use `size-5` instead of `h-5 w-5`
